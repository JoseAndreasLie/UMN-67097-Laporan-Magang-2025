	\textit{This report describes the backend development and enhancement process of the CHRIS (Concise Human Resource Information System) at PT Ganda Visi Jayatama. The project focused on integrating new features such as biometric authentication for CHRISM (CHRIS Mobile), a tree-based hierarchical leave approval system, and the complete development of a Payroll module. The User Management module was also improved by enhancing input validation. The system was developed using the PERN Stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) with an Agile methodology. During the project, 17 new API endpoints were developed and 7 existing endpoints were enhanced, resulting in a total of 24 active endpoints. Manual testing was conducted throughout the development. The outcomes included improved payroll efficiency and accuracy, increased system access security through biometrics, and a more flexible leave approval process. Technical challenges such as non-standardized code, hardcoded values, and complex historical data handling were resolved through code refactoring, enhanced data structures, and optimized migration processes.}
